    <h1>i hate modern day web design</h1>
    <br>
    <a>I hate modern web design, and I'm not the only person who does. All companies have adapted to this "modern" design which in my opinion looks really cringe, childish and boring. Of course, there are people who really like the modern design and I don't blame them. We all have different taste. And I also understand that websites have to adapt to stay relevant. Back 8 years ago when web design wasn't so fucking awful I was curious to explore many different sites to see all sorts of interesting design choices, but know when I'm visiting a new website all I really expect is a dark mode background, AND ALSO THESE STUPID LOOKING MOTHERFUCKERS</a>

    <a>I just really want the good old design with nice gradients and nice backgrounds backgrounds to come back, but that will most likely never happen.</a>
